# AWS-Deepracer-Solution

I made a reward function for the AWS DeepRacer Student league. I used reinforcement learning to come up with the solution. I gave reward to the model when it did the work well and accordingly I punished it. It was all in all a good experience for me to participate in it. I Pre-qualified for the scholarship as I passed their requirement of completing three laps in 3 minutes.
